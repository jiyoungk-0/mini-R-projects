# COVID-19 Data Analysis: South Korea vs. United States

# This project, implemented in R, analyzes COVID-19 data to compare the impact of the pandemic between South Korea and the United States. 
# The analysis focuses on death percentages, median age, hospital beds per thousand, and vaccination rates over time.

# Libraries Used
  # readr: For reading CSV files.
  # dplyr: For data manipulation.
  # ggplot2: For data visualization.
  # tidyverse: For a collection of R packages designed for data science.

# Insights

# Differences in Healthcare Systems and Pandemic Response:
  # Healthcare Infrastructure: South Korea has a robust healthcare system with universal coverage, 
  #     while the U.S. has a more fragmented system with varying levels of access to healthcare.
  # Pandemic Response: South Korea implemented aggressive testing, contact tracing, and isolation measures early on, 
  #     whereas the U.S. faced challenges with testing capacity and response uniformity.
  # Hospital Capacity and ICU Availability: South Korea may have better hospital capacity management, 
  #     whereas the U.S. faced periods of overwhelming demand, affecting death rates.
  # Public Health Interventions: South Koreaâ€™s strict public health interventions, such as mask mandates and quarantine measures, 
  #     may have contributed to fewer deaths relative to infections.

# Additional Factors
  # Population Density and Urbanization: South Korea's higher population density and urbanization might necessitate more hospital beds.
  # Healthcare Policies and Funding: Differences in policies, funding, and system organization can influence hospital bed availability.
  # Historical and Cultural Factors: South Korea's historical emphasis on public health and healthcare investments might lead to higher hospital bed availability.
